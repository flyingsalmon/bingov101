Player v CPU Bingo Game (American version)

A BINGO (American version) card is a 5x5 grid where each column has 5 rows and column B will have the random digits 1 to 15,
column I will have digits 16-30, N will have 31-45 , G will have 46-60, and column O will have 61-75;
and no column should have the same number repeated, and the center cell (cell N3) will be marked 'X'.

WARNING: Marking FREE cell with anything other than 'X' which is used to mark a match will cause complications in code.

This is a player v CPU version of the game. For educational and entertainment purposes only.
